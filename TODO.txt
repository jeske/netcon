* Netcon - Network Condition Monitoring Tool
*
*      ---  TODO  ---
*

0) Basic bringup

   - (done) database schema/odb
   - (done) error/incident manager
   - (done) basic test               #  test.py 
   - (done) first webpage            #  http://c1.neotonic.com/netcon/index.py
   - (done) first agent monitor      #  Disk monitor
   - (done) agent cron mode
   - (done) agent data-submission
   - basic trigger config
   - basic incident notifications
   - agent daemon run-loop
   - UI: better display of incident failure
   - UI: incident notes
   - UI: resolve/close incident
   - new data addition optimization (txn?)
   - data-resolution reduction

2) Agent Data Monitors

   - (done) disk usage 
   - (done) memory usage
   - (done) cpu usage
   - ping
   - innodbtablespace
   - directory/queue count
   - RAID status
   - http
   - dns
   - snmp
   - process state
   - tcp chat (connect,request,response)
   - web (http,https)
   - oracletablespace

3) Server UI

   - incident details / notes
   - resolve incident / watch timeout
   - configuration
     - machine hierarchy
     - server-side per-agent state configuration
     - machine roles
     - role triggers
   - machine view
   - role view
   - stat/source history (data/graph)

4) Notification System

   - multiple levels of triggers, 'info', 'warning', 'error', 'failure'
   - ex: wait longer to notify at night (in case it resolves), for example,
         a network failure might have longer timeouts at night
   - ex: automatic cyclic shift descriptions, pick period (daily,weekly,monthly,etc),
         then fill in slots on that period
   - ex: incident/notification domains - match into incident domains based
         on service type (network, vs machine, vs db, vs service), or based on
         machine subtree. Notification list is different for different incident
         domains.
   - ex: priority fallbacks for non-responsive oncall personel
         (i.e. 5min : alert of problem, 10min : alert of non-response to problem,
               15min : alert of next on-call person)

5) Features / Designs

   - notification config/shifts/user watch/incident watch timer
   - redundant role triggers
      - ex: 10 machines in "Public UI" role, any one of them
            failing is a warning, > 40% failing is an error
   - separation of triggers/incidents by level and/or hierarchy
   - hierarchial suppression
   - 'derivative values' plugin system
      - spike detection
        - width/height of spike
        - abs, or relative to current values
        - ex: queue size jump
      - trend prediction
        - trend computation paramaters (smoothing, window, decay)
        - predict time to target value
        - ex: time to run out of disk space
           - easy to view the current window
           - sort machines by their time to run out of space
           - create basic triggers on the time (<48hours)
           - create multiple trend predictors "short term" and 
             "long term" by tuning values
      - cyclic trend prediction
        - ex: will the system have capacity tomorrow morning?
        - ex: will the system have capacity next holiday?
    - trigger based fixes...
        - ex: single webserver has really long timeouts, but
              all the other servers in the role are functioning
              normally
        - shutdown and reboot server
        - remove a server from load balancer
    - maintain other organizations of machines
        - ex: rack location, power control, serial console
        - provide a query interface so tools can use this data easily.
          - ex: "./powercycle.py c1" finds out what apc port c1 is on from netcon
            - Provide these plugin tools inside Netcon server
